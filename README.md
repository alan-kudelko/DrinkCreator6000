# DrinkCreator6000 ‚Äì RTOS System on Custom AVR Board
DrinkCreator6000 is a real-time operating system (RTOS) project designed for a custom-built drink dispensing machine powered by an AVR microcontroller and FreeRTOS. The system is entirely based on static memory allocation for robustness and predictability, and integrates multiple hardware modules for a fully functional beverage control unit.

The machine is powered by a standard 400W ATX power supply, which provides stable 5V and 12V rails for the logic circuitry, Peltier cooling modules, and peristaltic pumps used for dispensing liquids. Pumps are controlled via a 74HC595 shift register, which expands digital output lines and drives MOSFET transistors to switch the high-current 12V loads safely and efficiently.

Temperature is regulated using Peltier elements coupled with an internal water cooling system, enclosed within the device chassis for thermal efficiency and thermal isolation.

User input is handled via a PCF8574N I¬≤C I/O expander, which generates interrupts only when button states change ‚Äî minimizing CPU load and improving responsiveness. System status, temperature data, and diagnostics are displayed on a 2004 character LCD screen driven over the I¬≤C bus, allowing real-time monitoring directly from the front panel.

> üîß Status: In development  
> üß™ Goal: Create a fully functional, physical drink machine and explore structured multi-tasking using FreeRTOS AVR MCU.
